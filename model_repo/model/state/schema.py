"""The rolling state schema.

Every field has a default so `ModelState()` is the well-defined initial
state. The state is frozen (immutable); `advance()` returns a new state via
`model_copy(update=...)`.

Fields are organized into three tiers. The tiers are conceptual guidance,
not Python-enforced — the optimizer should feel free to add fields to
whichever tier they belong in.


# Tier 1 — Base

Unconditional bookkeeping that every subsequent stage can rely on:
how many tokens have been seen, what the previous token was, recent
context, etc. Updated by `pipeline.counters.update_basic_counters`.


# Tier 2 — Linguistic

High-level structural features you could point at with a linguistics
term. Examples:
  - clause_depth, chars_since_period, chars_since_comma
  - word_position (how deep into the current word we are)
  - sentence_type (declarative / interrogative / imperative / exclamative)
  - speaker_label_state (FSM over "\n\nNAME:\n" patterns)
  - verse_mode, syllable_position_in_line, iambic_phase
  - morphology markers (is the current suffix -ing? -ed? -ly?)
  - syntactic role of the most recent completed word

Updated by the linguistic stage of the pipeline. These are fields any
NLP textbook would recognize.


# Tier 3 — Flow

Moody, stylistic, rhythmic features — harder to define precisely,
sometimes overlapping with linguistic state but captured along a
different axis. Examples:
  - register_tension (formal ↔ colloquial)
  - emotional_arc (rising ↔ falling)
  - cadence (staccato ↔ flowing)
  - imagery_density (abstract ↔ vivid)
  - urgency (languid ↔ frantic)
  - formality_drift
  - vowel_saturation

Updated by the flow stage of the pipeline. These fields encode
something a reader feels before they can name. They may not map to
clean categories; continuous floats and soft flags are welcome.
